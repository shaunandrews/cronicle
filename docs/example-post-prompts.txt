I want to write a post about the new world of AI, and how we can make peace with change by looking through history. AI will change our lives. And me, as a digital designer, my career has a potential to completely change. Talk about how even just 50 years ago, the idea of a "digitial designer" was ludicrous; my grandfather often thought I didn't have a "real" job. The idea of sitting at a computer writing code or drawing pictures—in 50 years time—will likely be seen as archaic. Our grandkids will have trouble understanding how we built careers around writing code. Instead, there will be new careers built around things I couldn't possible foresee.
